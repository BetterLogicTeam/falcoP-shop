                <div className="space-y-4 text-sm">
                  <p><span className="text-falco-accent font-semibold">1. Mandatory Consumer Law (Konsumentköplagen):</span> Swedish consumer law is very strong and favors the consumer. Your terms cannot override a consumer's statutory rights, such as the right to a 3-year warranty against defects and the right to complain within a reasonable time.</p>
                  
                  <p><span className="text-falco-accent font-semibold">2. Dispute Resolution:</span> Unlike the US model of mandatory arbitration, the preferred and standard method for consumer disputes in Sweden is through the National Board for Consumer Disputes (Allmänna reklamationsnämnden, ARN).</p>
                  
                  <p><span className="text-falco-accent font-semibold">3. Company Information:</span> EU law requires you to provide clear and easily accessible company information, including your legal business name, registration number, and physical address.</p>
                  
                  <p><span className="text-falco-accent font-semibold">4. Language:</span> The official terms must be provided in Swedish to be enforceable against Swedish consumers. This English version should be considered a courtesy translation.</p>
                  
                  <p><span className="text-falco-accent font-semibold">5. Returns & Right of Withdrawal (Ångerrätt):</span> For distance selling, consumers in the EU have a mandatory 14-day "right of withdrawal" to return products for any reason. This must be clearly stated in a separate Returns Policy.</p>
